xslt-header translations version 0.2

Tested with Delphi6 /win2k

The following dlls are neccesary and must be placed in this directory or in the 
\WINNT\system32 directory:

iconv.dll
libxml2.dll
libxslt.dll
libexslt.dll

You can download them at:

Known Problems:

- extending the xslt-processor with own functions doesn't work yet
- to see, which parts of the header translations aren't done yet,
  look at undone.txt
- no demo-program yet
