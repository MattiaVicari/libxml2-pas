TODO:

GENERAL
	- create test functions and a mechanism to invoke them
	-

KYLIX
	- xmlParseFile is crashing when marked as cdecl; marked as register it does not crash, but always returns NIL - but aparently it must be cdecl.
	- the same applies for many other functions
	- IDE refuses to load the library; therefore any attempt to debug the code fails (with no message!!)
