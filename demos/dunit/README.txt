This directory is reserved for dunit, the Delphi Unit Testing Environment.

There is a Makefile that puts the sources here.


Linux users:
	type "make"

Cygwin users:
	type "make OSTYPE=cygwin"

Usage without make:
You need to download the dunit package, extract it, 
and move all files from its 'src' directory here.

Enjoy,
