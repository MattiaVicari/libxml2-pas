This is the updated source of the demo, until now
distributed as dom2_demo.zip.

To compile, you also need the files from the folders:
dom2
libxml2
data

So far tested with Delphi 6 only.

It's a graphical program that performs the follwing
test:
a) Test 98 of 100 DOM2 functions
b) a simple tree walker
c) Benchmark the speed of treewalking and parsing

You can switch between msxml-dom and libxml2 at runtime.
