UNIT TESTING for libxmldom.pas

I use this program for new dom2 test routines.

Before I was using the program "dom2demo.dpr" for testing
the dom. (from the demos/dom2/test folder)

To compile it, you have to include utils/dunit into your
library search path.

If you have ideas for more tests, add them to 
LIBXMLTestCase.pas.

Some tests are meant to find memory leaks.
I use the windows task manager for that task, if you
know how to check the memory usage of the program (with
the usage of the dll's) by the program itself, please write
an email.

Have fun!
