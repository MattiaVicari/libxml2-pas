Using libxml2-pas in your projects:
-----------------------------------

- make sure that the directory libxml2 is in your "search path" list.
	In the Delphi/Kylix IDE, you can set it here: Project | Options... | Directories/Conditionals | Search path

- make sure that the libxml2.so file is listed either in /etc/ld.so.conf system file or in LD_LIBRARY_PATH env. variable.
- now you can start the program
