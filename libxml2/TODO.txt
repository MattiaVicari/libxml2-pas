libxml2-pas: libxml2 header header translation for Pascal

TODO
====
- more examples
- automate updates of inline doc (comments) - create a script
- FILE* arguments in some functions - check if it is possible to use them really in Pascal
- error api: add a unit to make it easy to use
- xmlXPathObject.boolval: find out if the translation is correct, or why it looks so strange
- complete translation of iconv.pas
- generate actually defined DEFINEs from the source (dunno how atm)
- translate remaining macros in all units (e.g. xpathInternals)
- use libxml2-api.xml to check completeness of translation

DONE
====
- Delphi Memory Manager is used, which allowed also translation of xmlFree()
- autodetection of changes in header files in gnome-xml CVS base ('make checkapi')
- all header files translated
- Bjorn Reese modified libxml2 to not use SIGFPE which made many api functions to crash when called in Delphi programs
