Following are rules for syntax of Pascal files.
Petr Kozelka (C) 2002

1. Indentation
1.1. always use 2 spaces
1.2. no TABs should be in the .pas, .dpr or .inc source file

2. Identifiers 
2.1. New identifiers
	- when declaring an identifier, always make its prefixing/sufixing coherent 
	  throughout the whole project, or at least the unit

2.2. Referrencing identifiers
	- when referrencing an existing identifier, use exactly the namecase with which it was declared

3. Programming constructs
3.1. "if"
	- do never use comparison with boolean constants, like:
	if (myFlag=true)	// WRONG! 
	then doSomething
	else doSomethingElse

	Just use the boolean value (or negated value)

3.2. "end"
	- always align "end" with the first character of the construct being ended. 
	Example 1:
		if (myTest) then begin
		  // ...
		end else begin
		  // ...
		end;
	Example 2:
		for i:=1 to 5 do begin
		  // ...
		end;

4. Special comments
4.1. //TODO <+some text>
	- marks a feature that should be implemented, but the developper didn't have 
	  time yet, or is waiting for something
4.2. //BUG <+some text>
	- marks a place that was discoverred buggy, but is tempoarily necessary. Should be fixed asap.
	- alternatively, one developper can mark this way a place where he found a bug, 
	  to make it easier to the one who will work on it
