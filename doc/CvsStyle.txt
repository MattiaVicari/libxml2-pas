Following are rules defining how to work with CVS
Petr Kozelka (C) 2002

1. General
	- the repository content should always be independent of any concrete working environment
1.1. checkout
	- it is always assumed that the whole repository including all modules is checked out ("cvs co .")
1.2. commit
	- always commit a semantically closed block, and make the description really descriptive. 
	  The "cvs log" should be always a good start for documentation. So, descriptions like 
	  "many various changes" should never be there. 
	- it is better to commit 20 times with good description of changes than once with a no-description.

2. Directory structure
	TODO (as agreed earlier, I will fill this later)

3. Files under revision control
3.1. What should never be uploaded
	- long binary files (archives, executables, photos, other binary data)
	- configuration plaintext files which contain absolute directory references
		- for Delphi/Kylix, it means: .DOF, .CFG, .DSK, .KOFF, ...
	- third party source code. Instead, there should be a script to download and move the files wherever 
	  appropriate.
3.2. What is acceptable
	- small icons/bitmaps, that do not change frequently
	- configuration files mentioned above, if the name is extended with ".in" and content 
	  carefully checked against absolute directory references. In this case, it is recommended
	  to provide a script (or preferrably a Makefile target) that renames and performs anything 
	  necessary with the ".in" file. This should be mentioned in the README.txt file
3.3. What should primarily be in CVS
	- any Pascal sources (.pas, .inc, .dpr)
	- Delphi and Kylix forms saved as TEXT (.dfm, .kfm)
	- README.txt (in each directory) and other documentation files (HOWTOs etc.)
	- Makefile's
